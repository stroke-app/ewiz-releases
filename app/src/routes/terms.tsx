        <p>
          eWiz is a small menu-bar app that helps look after your Mac&apos;s battery. These terms
          cover the app, this website, and your license. By installing eWiz or buying a license, you
          agree to them.
        </p>

      <Section n="01" title="Who we are">
        <p>
          eWiz is an independent macOS app built and distributed by Nischal from <b>ewiz.app</b>. It
          runs entirely on your own Mac. Creating an account or purchasing a license means you
          accept these terms.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="02" title="The software">
        <p>
          eWiz is proprietary software, protected by copyright. When you buy a license, you get a
          personal, non-transferable right to install and run eWiz on Macs you own or control. You
          may not resell, sublicense, or redistribute the app or your license key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is provided <b>as is</b>. It talks to low-level battery and charging controls on
          your Mac, and while it&apos;s built carefully and conservatively, you use it at your own
          discretion. See the warranty and liability sections below.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="03" title="Accounts">
        <p>
          You don&apos;t need an account to try eWiz. It&apos;s free to use for 30 days with no
          sign-up. You only create an account when you buy a license, so we can attach it to you and
          let you manage it. Sign-in is handled through <b>GitHub</b> or <b>Google</b>; we never see
          or store a password.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="04" title="Licenses">
        <p>
          A license is a <b>one-time $2.99 purchase</b> (plus any applicable tax). There is no
          subscription. It&apos;s yours forever and includes every future update.
        </p>
        <p>
          A license activates on <b>one Mac at a time</b>. If you switch to a different Mac, you can
          move your license to it once every <b>30 days</b> from your dashboard. This keeps things
          simple for genuine upgrades while discouraging casual sharing.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="05" title="Trial, payments, and refunds">
        <p>
          eWiz is free for 30 days of actual use. The countdown only advances on days you open the
          app, so you can decide before paying anything. Checkout is handled securely by{" "}
          <b>Dodo Payments</b>, our merchant of record; we never see your card details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because you can try the full app free before buying, sales are generally final. That said,
          if you were double-charged, or your license genuinely won&apos;t activate and we
          can&apos;t fix it, reach out within <b>14 days</b> and we&apos;ll make it right.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="06" title="Acceptable use">
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Circumvent, disable, or tamper with license verification.</li>
          <li>
            Reverse-engineer, decompile, or redistribute the app except where the law allows it.
          </li>
          <li>Use eWiz in any way that breaks applicable laws or harms others.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section n="07" title="Your data">
        <p>
          eWiz reads your Mac&apos;s battery and charging state locally to do its job. Your usage,
          battery readings, and settings <b>stay on your machine</b> and are never transmitted to
          us. Our servers only ever handle your account and license. See the{" "}
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for the full picture.

      </Section>

      <Section n="08" title="Warranty disclaimer">
        <p>
          eWiz is provided <b>&ldquo;as is&rdquo;</b> and <b>&ldquo;as available&rdquo;</b>, without
          warranties of any kind, express or implied. Battery hardware, macOS behavior, and charging
          controllers vary between machines and OS versions. We don&apos;t warrant that eWiz will be
          uninterrupted, error-free, or suitable for any particular purpose.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="09" title="Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, eWiz and its author won&apos;t be liable for any
          indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Total liability for any claim is capped at
          the amount you paid for your license in the 12 months before the claim.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="10" title="Changes to these terms">
        <p>
          We may update these terms from time to time. When we make a material change, we&apos;ll
          update the date at the top of this page. Continuing to use eWiz after a change means you
          accept the updated terms.
